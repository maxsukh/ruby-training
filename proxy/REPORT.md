  * Have you removed **all** redundant code
* Miscellaneous Criteria - **10%**
  * Git commit history (Easy to understand / follow)

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

C

Whilst in principle your attempt is good. You have skipped quite a lot of steps and lumped large code changes
into single commits that don't really convey their changes. I would expect a few more commits with a little
bit more information about what you did

In terms of red-green refactor or iteration, there also isn't much evidence of this to go off

### Pass Rate

A

All tests pass clean

### White box analysis

B

Your code is quite neat and tidy, and you definitely have been lean

Your code has lots of linting issues, and hasn't removed all redundant code

### Miscellaneous Criteria

C

The git commit messages are'nt very informative

### Overall Grade

B

This is a solid B. You have done what was expected of you, and done it well

In order to improve this kind of project further, you need to start thinking about how others will perceive
your work. However this is an area in which nearly all people are struggling
