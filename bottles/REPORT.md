## Grades

### Following TDD principles

A

All principles followed well. I think you are probably a "low" A, but you have basically got the hang of
what needs to be done.

I would focus more on making sure that the refactors themselves are usually improving your code. Sometimes
the refactors you have done look as if they are making your code worse.

### Pass Rate

A

Solid achievement, but again just an A, it seemed like your pass rate flitted backwards and forwards and seemed
to vary quite a bit.

### White box analysis

B

Your linting is good. I disagree with some of the styles but you are starting to adhere to a "style". This is
half of the battle.

Your code is reasonably easy to follow, and I have no qualms with trying to understand the logic.

Almost no redundant code is removed. Quite a lot of excess weight is added to your project.

### Miscellaneous Criteria

B

Not a bad attempt. Some bits are a bit flimsy. I would focus on being a little bit more descriptive / accurate.

### Overall Grade

A

Well done on getting an A. I feel as though you "just" did enough to get the A here. I definitely feel there
is a lot of improvement to be made in the Whitebox analysis area.
