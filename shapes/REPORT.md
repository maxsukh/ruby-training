    * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
* White box analysis
    * Is your code neat and tidy?
    * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
    * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer)?
* Miscellaneous Criteria
    * N/A

## Grades

### Following TDD principles
C

For triangles very good TDD was done.
For quadrilaterals it seems no TDD was attempted. Including the attempts to refactor redundant code
For angles some TDD was attempted.

The refactoring attempts were ok, but again didn't really showcase the point of refactoring existing
code into more optimal code or removing redundant parts

### Pass Rate
A

All tests pass. Solid work.

### White box analysis
C

Lots of code here isn't needed, but overall you have got the right idea.

Given you are correct with a lot of what you have written, I couldn't mark this a D, but if you were wrong
on some areas, I would mark this a D

I would suggest that you revise what each individual portion of code does, specifically around local variables

### Miscellaneous Criteria
N/A - Not being used for this project

### Overall Grade
B

Not a bad first attempt. I would definitely look into "how" you are doing refactoring across the entire project.

Also remember in ruby each method always returns something.

Git work was strong, I found myself able to understand why you were doing certain things
